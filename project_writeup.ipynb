    "For Tree Census Data, we used three MapReduce jobs for data cleaning and profiling. The first one is to split the original csv file with the delimiter \"comma\". And then the problem came, since there are some cells containing commas inside, when splitting, it will automatically split the values inside the cell with commas. And this results in longer-than-expected records and in the meanwhile, the longer records will have the fields dislocated. To be more specific, if one cell with comma inside is split, then this will result in two items, one in the original field, and the other one in the next field and pushes everything ahead. To fix this problem, we choose to drop all columns with length that is not 45. At the same time, we also dropped the unwanted column and there are only five columns left."

    "Next, when we do another data profiling to group all the data by the borough field, it happens that in the borough field, there are some numeric values instead of a string of borough name. We applied the isNumeric() function to the third MapReduce job to filter the entries that is not a borough name. And after doing so, when we redo the count records job, there are 611571 records left. In face, the number of records deleted is 72107, which is 10% of the original records, so that the cleaning will not fundamentally affect the result of our data analytic."

    "After I cleaned the data set and made it into only five columns, the analytic became much more easier.For this data set, we mainly considered the healthy level of trees, the life status of trees, and the borough where the trees located in. And since there are two factors together to determine the final score of each borough, we shall split this scoring into two parts: positive for the number of good healthy trees, and negative for the number of poor health or dead trees. The more good healthy trees are, the higher the score is; while the more poor or dead trees are, the lower the score is. Therefore, there are the two split assessments and we shall begin with the positive one.\n",

And after Manhattan, Brooklyn has the second highest density of poor health trees. The reason why these to boroughs has such high rate of poor healthy trees might be that the number of cars and the amount of pollution in these two boroughs are higher than that in the other ones."
